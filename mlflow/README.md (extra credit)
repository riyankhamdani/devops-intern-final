# MLFlow optional demo

This folder can contain a minimal MLflow example: a small script that logs a dummy metric, plus a docker-compose to run mlflow + postgresql + artifact store.
Example command to run a dummy run:

python -c "import mlflow; mlflow.set_experiment('demo'); with mlflow.start_run(): mlflow.log_metric('mse', 0.123)"
